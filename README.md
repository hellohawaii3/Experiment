# Experiment

Console contains the console codes. Open Console/Console/Console.sln, run in Debug. This version of codes can not work as expected.

GUI/GUI contains the Windows Desktop App codes. Open, GUI/GUI//GUI.sln, run in Debug. Press F8, the application quit from message loop as expected and pop up a message box saying "APP QUIT".

Thanks for your attention!
